# Indian Currency Note Classification

Welcome to the Indian Currency Note Classification project! This project focuses on classifying real-time Indian currency notes of various denominations using deep learning models and data augmentation techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Classify Indian currency notes based on their denomination using computer vision models.
- **Data Collection**: Real-time Indian currency notes of all denominations were collected for training and testing.
- **Data Augmentation**: The image dataset was augmented using ImageDataGenerator to increase its diversity and improve model generalization.

## Models and Training

- **Models**: Two deep learning models were trained for classification:
  - **ResNet-50**: A widely used convolutional neural network architecture.
  - **YOLOv8m-cls**: A YOLO (You Only Look Once) variant designed for classification tasks.

- **Training Data**: The models were trained on the collected and augmented dataset.

- **Testing Performance**:
  - ResNet-50 achieved a testing accuracy of 90.17%.
  - YOLOv8m-cls achieved an impressive testing accuracy of 95.5%.
  - Testing was performed on a set of 900 unseen images.



## Future Work

Consider the following for future improvements:

- Fine-tuning and optimizing models for real-world applications.
- Expanding the dataset to include more currency denominations or variations.
- Deploying the models in practical scenarios, such as currency counting machines or mobile applications.
